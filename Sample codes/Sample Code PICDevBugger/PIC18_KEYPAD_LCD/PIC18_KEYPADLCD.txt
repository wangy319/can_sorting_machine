This code serve as a simple demostratoin for how to read from keypad input and display it on the LCD in C. Upon startup, the LCD will display the character corrosponding to the key pressed on the keypad.
Note the prog/run switch must be switched to 'RUN' inorder for keypad input to work properly, since the keypad encoder share pins with the programmer.
