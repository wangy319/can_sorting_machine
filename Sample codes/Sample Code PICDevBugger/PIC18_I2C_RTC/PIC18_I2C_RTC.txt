This piece of code serve as a I2C master read and write demostration. The PIC will first set time of the RTC chip (DS1307) to 2016 December 31, 23:59:45, then read back the time kept on the RTC and display on the LCD. The code might not functoin correctly unless the prog/run switch is set to RUN. It is good practice to always set the switch back to RUN after programming inorder to avoid stange behavior of the PIC during runtime.
This code will also work identically if the boards are equipped with a DS1308 time keeping chip (surface mount variant).
