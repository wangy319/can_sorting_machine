; * Function:        _LogicAnalyzerAsm - 
; *                 WORD LogicAnalyzerAsm(WORD RiseFallMask, WORD SamplingDelay)
; *
; * Overview:        Logic analyzer with edge detection, sample rate up to 1MHz
; *
; * PreCondition:    Interrupts disabled
; *
; * Input:           cnvEdgeMask, PostTrigCount
; *
; * Output:          TrigCount - trigger location
; *                  RAM 0x4000-0x4400 : 1024 samples
; *
; * Side Effects:    Writes RAM addresses 0x4000 to 0x4400 as one sample per 
; *                  location
; *
; * Note:            Samples are stored as one sample per word. Some post 
; *                  processing is performede afterwards to make it compatible
; *                  with the PICkit 2 app. This could be changed in the future
; *                  W3 stores trigger location
; *                  W6 contains address pointer
; *                  W7 holds the delay 
; *                  W8 stores rise/fall pointer
; *                  W9 stores last sample
; *                  W10 contains the edge mask
; *                  W11 contains Post Trigger Count
; *                  W12 presample count, and temporary holder
