#PIC18\_I2C\_ARDUINO
The arduino sketch contains a slightly modified example program
for the nano to recieve the I2C messages from the PIC.

The PIC reads in the keypad and sends the charvalue over I2C to the
arduino, which outputs it over serial connection to the computer.

*Remember to enable the arduino's A4 and A5 pins on the board*
