Plans for Coding

1. Finish all of the state code for one can first, make it work, then modify it for another can. (Pop can first, because tin can is easier)

2. 	MAIN
		standby mode setting
	
		If start is pressed -> Interrupt to the operation level LEVEL 1

	LEVEL1
		mechanical parts move

		2 FSM

		3s -> terminate


3. When using interrupt, make sure the memory is enough.
