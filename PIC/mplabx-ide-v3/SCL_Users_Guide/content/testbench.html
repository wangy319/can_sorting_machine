		<p>
			Every SCL program must contain one and only one testbench.  
			Testbenches contain processes, variables, constants etc.  It can 
			also be empty, though there is little reason to do so.
		</p>
		<p>
			Here is an empty testbench to show the basic syntax:
		</p>
		<code>
			<pre class="precode">testbench for PIC32MX360F512L is</pre>
			<pre class="precode">   <i>// processes, variables, etc. go here</i></pre>
			<pre class="precode">end testbench;</pre>
		</code>
		<p>
		In earlier versions of MPLAB IDE the device name had to match the device
		of the project the SCL code was ran against.  But in MPLAB X the device
		name is ignored and is decorative only.
